# Bachelorprojekt

This project contains an implementation of several key functionalities that can be used to do inference using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project contains both an implementation in Python (which is found in the Python folder) and an implementation on a FPGA. The FPGA version is written in C#, however, the SME framework is used to translate the C# code to VHDL.
